# Tic Tac Toe Intelligent Agent with Minimax

This project is from Claflin University's CSCI 404 - Machine Intelligence. I stumbled on the question and thought it would be a fun project to work on. I'm working with C# because I just picked up the langauge and I'm trying to get my feet wet.

## Question

Write a program that creates a tic tac toe game with two players. Each round the game prints the board using _ for an empty space, X for player 1, and O for player 2. The game should ask player 1 to enter 2 integers to represent the coordinates to place X. The computer will be player O and will automatically play after player 1. Develop an intelligent agent that will beat player 1.

Use a multi-dimensional array to store the game board.

Sample board after round 1:

After each round, your game must:

1. Print the board
2. Check for a winner

A player wins if they have 3 in a row (vertically, horizonatally, or diagonally).

You will be graded on your agen's ability to win the game
